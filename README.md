## Decipher - Food scanning web application
### Purpose: Scan barcodes to reveal health information

### Goals
- Set-up a reliable barcode scanning component
- Utilize open source food database for retrieving information based on barcode
- Create a scoring system based on nutrition facts/ingredients/packaging

### Status
- Working on the barcode scanning feature. Attempting to utilize Scandit SDK which is very reliable but having some issues scanning through web-app on a mobile device
- I have an alternative project utilizing an open source scanner but it is much less reliable. (Quagga)
